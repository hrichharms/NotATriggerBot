# NotATriggerBot
This is definitely not a trigger bot. It just happens to be the case that it can be used as one... if you want.

Have you ever wanted to have your mouse click with an inhuman reaction time as soon a pixel with a given offset from the center of your screen changes color? NotATriggerBot is for you~
